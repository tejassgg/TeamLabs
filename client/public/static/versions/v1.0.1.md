## Release 1.0.1: Enhanced Task Management & Subtasks

This release introduces comprehensive subtask functionality, improved task list visualization, and enhanced user experience features across the project management interface. The update focuses on better task organization, visual consistency, and streamlined workflows for project teams.

### Features

- **Subtask Display in Task List**: Subtasks now appear as individual rows beneath their parent tasks in the list view, providing clear visibility of task breakdowns
- **Interactive Subtask Management**: Users can mark and unmark subtasks as complete/incomplete directly from the task list with circular checkboxes
- **Subtask Column Mapping**: CompletedBy information displays in the "Assigned To" column, while CreatedBy information shows in the "Assignee" column for subtasks
- **Accordion Auto-Close**: Status sections with no tasks automatically close their accordions to reduce visual clutter
- **Enhanced Actions Column**: Added View and Delete buttons to the task list Actions column with consistent circular button styling
- **Subtask Toggle Functionality**: Real-time subtask completion status updates with loading states and user feedback

### Improvements & Bug Fixes

- **Column Alignment Fix**: Resolved column misalignment issues across different status sections by implementing fixed table layout with consistent column widths
- **Visual Consistency**: Updated action buttons to match existing UI patterns with circular buttons, proper shadows, and hover effects
- **Subtask Visual Hierarchy**: Added visual separation between subtask rows with reduced padding, borders, and indentation
- **API Enhancement**: Updated project-details API to include subtasks data with consistent field naming (attachmentsCount, commentsCount)
- **Accordion State Management**: Improved accordion initialization to dynamically open only sections containing tasks
- **Icon Updates**: Replaced FaEye with FaExternalLinkAlt for better semantic meaning of "Open Task" action
- **Responsive Design**: Enhanced mobile responsiveness for subtask display and action buttons
- **Theme Support**: Ensured proper styling for both light and dark themes across all new features

### Release Notes
No special notes for this release. All changes are backward compatible and require no migration steps. The subtask functionality leverages existing API endpoints and maintains data consistency with the current task management system.
